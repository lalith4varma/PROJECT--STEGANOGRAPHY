This project focuses on the concept of image steganography, where a secret message is embedded into an image's pixel values, allowing the image to function as a carrier for the hidden information. The user should be able to:
Embed a secret message into an image file, ensuring that the image looks visually unchanged to anyone viewing it.
Retrieve the hidden message from the image by providing a passcode for decryption.




The project requires you to install CV2 library




if u face this error :
